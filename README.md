# Obesity & Disease Impact Analysis

This project explores how obesity (specifically high BMI) contributes to mortality across major diseases — like stroke, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and more.

The idea was simple: understand the **real health cost of obesity**, not just as a percentage, but in actual human lives.

## Why this project?

I’m currently working through a data analyst bootcamp, and instead of doing something “safe” or easy, I wanted to work with real-world health data that actually *means* something. I wanted to go beyond dashboards and charts and ask bigger questions — like how many lives are impacted by obesity, and how it has evolved over the years.

## What you'll find

- Cleaned datasets comparing **total deaths** vs **deaths from high BMI** across:
  - Stroke
  - Ischemic Heart Disease
  - Chronic Respiratory Disease
  - Diabetes
  - Alzheimer's
- Breakdown by:
  - **Year**
  - **Sex**
  - **Age groups** (Under 40 / 40+)
- A merged dataset showing:
  - Total deaths
  - Deaths due to obesity
  - Percent contribution of obesity

## Tools used
- Python (Pandas, Jupyter)
- Data: [IHME Global Burden of Disease](https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/)
- Git / GitHub for version control and transparency

## What’s next?

This is still in progress — I’m planning to add:
- Visualizations (matplotlib or Tableau)
- A short write-up with insights and patterns across countries or regions

### Quick preview
*“In 2019, over 7% of all global stroke deaths in men over 40 were linked to high BMI. That’s not just a stat. That’s hundreds of thousands of lives.”*
